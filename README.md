# Simulate the Prisoner's Dilemma with Agents

## Overview
Code for a game theory simulation experiment based on the autogen framework. The Prisoner's Dilemma is implemented here.

I have implemented a complete simulation of the prisoner's Dilemma and provide a very flexible way to configure it. (In fact, it may be too complex, make it difficult.) It is possible to change the payoff matrix, the equilibrium goal, the agent's behavior, and specifically each step of the simulation.

The code can be run to perform a large number of simulation experiments with different settings for LLM-based agents. The results are all documented after each experiment is completed.
